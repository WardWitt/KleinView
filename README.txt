KleinView is a monitor calibration tool that converts XYZ samples received from the Klein Instruments K-10 colorimeter, converts them to D65 and then displays the values in various ways. KleinView is helpful for setting white balance on broadcast monitors and projectors.

If you have the USB version of the Klein K-10 you will also need FTDI's VCP driver to communicate with the K-10's internal USB to serial converter: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm. If you have the Serial version you will of course need an appropriate serial adapter and driver.
